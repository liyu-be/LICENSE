CardiFiNova: A Gamified DeFi Liquidity Aggregator
CardiFiNova is an innovative, all-in-one platform for the Cardano ecosystem. Our core purpose is to solve the problem of fragmented liquidity and poor user engagement in decentralized finance.

Key Features:

Unified Liquidity: Aggregate liquidity from all major Cardano DEXs into a single, intuitive interface.

Gamified Incentives: Engage users with a "Quests" system and a skill-based scoring model that rewards long-term liquidity providers.

NFT-Based Utility: Introduce "DeFi Passport" NFTs with real utility, such as boosted rewards and reduced fees, to foster a loyal community.

Roadmap:

Phase 1 (Q1-Q2): Core development of the aggregator and smart contract architecture. Testnet deployment of the gamified quest system.

Phase 2 (Q3-Q4): Mainnet launch, security audit, and full integration of the "DeFi Passport" NFT system.

Phase 3 (Ongoing): Community governance implementation, expansion to new dApps, and continuous feature development based on user feedback.
